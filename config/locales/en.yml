# Sample localization file for English. Add more files in this directory for other locales.
# See https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/tree/master/rails%2Flocale for starting points.

# NOTE: I'm not bothering with English strings for this system.  It is only designed to be run in Hebrew.  If you're re-using this code for something else, go ahead and create English strings.  If you need help understanding what the strings are for, write to me.
